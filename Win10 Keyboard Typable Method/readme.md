Here, I host the installer that I created for typing the letter of the TPA.
It's the same Qwerty keyboard with the same letters but it uses caps lock, shift, shift+caps lock and ctrl keys as
modifier keys for typing additional letters, the numbers above the letters are also assigned to more letters and the
numpad has the combining diacritics.

I don't believe this system of typing is perfect at all, but it is a system regardless.
It is better to use this alongside the toggleable caps lock Autohotkey script, I think it makes it easier typing that way.

I had to resort to using the caps lock key as a modifier key, since there were no capital letters in the TPA and I needed a
modifier key that was non-interfering with other operations of the computer.

Find that script here: https://github.com/SalviaSage/Autohotkey-Scripts-Repository/tree/master/Holdable%20Caps%20Lock
