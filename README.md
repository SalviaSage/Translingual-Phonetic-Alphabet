# Translingual Phonetic Alphabet
The Translingual Phonetic Alphabet (**TPA**) is a phonetic alphabet that is based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (**IPA**)

I created the **TPA** because I did not find the **IPA** to be accurate, legible, computer compatible nor extensive enough.

I wanted to create an alphabet that was more logical, that made more sense, that was more legible, that was more compatible
with computational linguistics and that was completely based on **Unicode** for use in computers.

(The **IPA** is also completely based on **Unicode**.)

In this repository, you can find some LibreOffice (**.ods**) document files that display the letters of the
Translingual Phonetic Alphabet as well as its combining diacritics and other graphical markings with information and audio files.

These spreadsheet files can also be opened in Microsoft Excel.

However some of the code that the spreadsheets use will not work there.

If you are looking for a good, capable font that can display all of the letters of the **TPA**.
I highly suggest that you download the font called **Code2000** and use it on any **TPA** phonetic transcription.

I am not the author of this font, but I am hosting it here as I can not find this font any more on the internet.

What are the differences between the IPA and the TPA?

The TPA is based on the IPA, however there are some important differences:

  Its vowel system is quite different than that of the IPA's.
However, its consonant system is similar to that of the IPA's.

  It orders the phones starting from the throat as it considers the starting point of the phones
and the first place of articulation for phones to be the glottis (throat) and the last place of articulation 
to be the nasal cavity (after the lips).

This is the opposite of the IPA because there, they order the places of articulations
starting from the lips going further back.

There isn't an official ordering of phones in the IPA, but in charts you often see it ordered starting from the lips.
This is not the case with the TPA as it is "officially" ordered starting from the glottis moving up.

The "Manner of Articulations" are also ordered starting from the most restrictive "Manner of Articulation" moving down
all the way down to the least restrictive "Manner of Articulation".

  TPA divides phones into two main categories called "simple phones" and "complex phones".
The simple phones are differentiated from one another based on the criteria of "places of articulation" (about 22 as of v2.1),
the "manners of articulation" (about 12 as of v2.1), voicing of the vocal cords (if applicable, 2 distinctions), as well as
the "manner of production". The "complex phones" are simple phones that have an added "secondary articulation" applied on to them. This secondary articulation can be a co-articulation with another phone or it can be a specific articulatory action within the vocal tract for example, a simple phone may be pronounced at the same time as the tongue being raised up towards the plate. This secondary articulation is called "palatalization" and this phone would be considered a "complex phone".

The manner of production is a concept that is not necessarily distinguished in the IPA.
But, what it is, is it deals with the articulatory mechanisms that are employed in the production of sounds.
There are 6 different distinct categories of "MoPs" in the TPA. They are:

Pulmonic Egressives (Pulmonics) (voiceless and voiced)
Pulmonic Ingressives (Pulmonic Ingressives) (voiceless and voiced)
Glottalic Egressives (Ejectives) (voiceless only)
Glottalic Ingressives (Implosives) (voiceless and voiced)
Lingual Egressives (Velarics) (voicing does not apply)
Lingual Ingressives (Clicks) (voicing does not apply)

There are different combinations of PoAs, MoAs, and other factors such as "occlusivity" which determines whether
a phone is possible to be articulated or not.

Proof is necessary for the inclusion of a phone into the TPA and currently there are over 350 different simple phones in the TPA.
Each one gets its own letter if possible. 

But, due to the shortage of compatible letters and an effort to make the alphabet simpler, some of these phones will use the same glyph as other phones, albeit with a combining diacritic or it will be accompanied by an arrow sign indicating a different
manner of production.

A vast array of combining diacritics and punctuation marks are provided in the TPA. Not only to indicate phonetic phenomena
but also to indicate and mark phonological as well as grammatical phenomena that may be found in a language.

The TPA is not designed with a specific language in mind, in fact it has nothing to do with any language but instead
it is entirelty designed based on the mechanisms of the human vocal tract.

The TPA is not designed for use in Diagnostic or Therapeutic fields. Although it may be used as such.
It is also not designed for use in the voice recognition technology, although I think it may be quite compatible for that.
