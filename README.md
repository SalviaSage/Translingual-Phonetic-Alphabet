# Translingual Phonetic Alphabet
The Translingual Phonetic Alphabet (**TPA**) is a phonetic alphabet that is based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (**IPA**).

I created the **TPA** because I found the **IPA** to be too inaccurate, illegible, computer incompatible and inextensive.

Don't get me wrong, I think the IPA is a great alphabet. Here is a wikipedia link to it if you want to learn more:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet

I wanted to create an alphabet that was more logical, that made more sense, that was more legible, that was more extensive,
that was more compatible with computational linguistics and that was completely based on **Unicode** for use in computers.

(The **IPA** also has complete representation in **Unicode**.)

**ABOUT:**
I created this alphabet after having taken a break from the study of phonetics in order to study computer programming.
There, I learned of the importance of logical thinking, as computer programs do not work if you do not follow logic.

After having understood the concept of logic, I came back to phonetics and now I was able to have a deeper understanding
of the subject. For example, I did not understand how ejective consonants were pronounced. Even though I read articles
which said that there were such consonant sounds and viewed a video clip where someone was pronouncing them correctly.
I myself was unable to pronounce them, nor did I know how to. However, I finally figured out how many different
sounds are pronounced in the human vocal tract and I proceeded to categorize them and create my own phonetic alphabet.


In this repository, you can find some LibreOffice (**.ods**) document files as well as other files
that document the letters of the Translingual Phonetic Alphabet as well as its combining diacritics and other graphical markings
with information and audio files.

The alphabet is still in development, however it has come to a usable point after version 2.

These spreadsheet files can also be opened in Microsoft Excel.
(Note: some of the code that the spreadsheets use will not work there.)

If you are looking for a good, capable font that can display all of the letters of the **TPA**.
I highly suggest that you download the font called **Code2000** and use it on any **TPA** phonetic transcription.

I can not guarantee that the letters of the TPA will show correctly in any other font as I am testing the alphabet on the use
of this font, however other fonts may also give satisfactory results.

I am not the author of this font, but I am hosting it here as I can not find this font anywhere else.
