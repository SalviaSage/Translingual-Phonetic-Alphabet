# Translingual Phonetic Alphabet
The Translingual Phonetic Alphabet (**TPA**) is a phonetic alphabet that is based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (**IPA**).

I created the **TPA** because I found the **IPA** to be inaccurate, illegible, computer incompatible and inextensive.

I wanted to create an alphabet that was more logical, that made more sense, that was more legible, that was more extensive,
that was more compatible with computational linguistics and that was completely based on **Unicode** for use in computers.

(The **IPA** is also completely based on **Unicode**.)

In this repository, you can find some LibreOffice (**.ods**) document files as well as other files
that document the letters of the Translingual Phonetic Alphabet as well as its combining diacritics and other graphical markings
with information and audio files.

The alphabet is still in development, however it has come to a usable point after version 2.

These spreadsheet files can also be opened in Microsoft Excel.
(Note: some of the code that the spreadsheets use will not work there.)

If you are looking for a good, capable font that can display all of the letters of the **TPA**.
I highly suggest that you download the font called **Code2000** and use it on any **TPA** phonetic transcription.

I can not guarantee that the letters of the TPA will show correctly in any other font as this alphabet is developed solely
using this particular font.

I am not the author of this font, but I am hosting it here as I can not find this font any more on the internet.

If you want to see in which way the TPA differs from the IPA or want to get general information regarding the TPA, read below.

~~~
	What are the differences between the IPA and the TPA?
The TPA is based on the IPA, however there are some important differences;
Both its consonant and vowel system is based on the IPA and both areas are changed.

The TPA has 28 simple vocoids (vowels) + 4 semi-vowels (approximants).
This number is set and will not be changing in the future versions.

The vowels are based on the metrics of the human mouth, the tongue, the jaw and the rounding of the lips.

(Establishing the vowel system was difficult. Eventually, I believe I established a system that works.)

The vocoids are more so approximations than the contoids due to their free floating nature and being "unrestricted"
from the places of articulations that the contoids are placed on. Nonetheless, I believe they are accurate approximations.

Please download the included file vocoids.rar to hear these vocoids.

Also, the vowels do not employ a different system than the contoids, they relate to the contoids.
There are no 2 different charts for vocoids and contoids in the TPA.

It is all a fluid transition from the most restricted of sounds to the least restricted sounds in the human vocal tract.

There are about 280 or possibly up to 300 simple contoid phones (consonants) in the TPA.
Because, more contoids are being discovered and added, this number is not set and is ever growing (unlike the vowels).

They don't all have their own glyphs because there are so many of them and there aren't enough appropriate letters.
But, they are all written distinctively from one another with the help of accompanying arrow characters and diacritics.

Thus, although some of these phonetic letters may use the same glyphs, no two sound has an identical letter.

====================================================================================================
THE PLACES OF ARTICULATIONS:
====================================================================================================
The TPA "officially" orders the phones starting from the throat as it considers the starting point of speech
and the first place of articulation in the vocal tract to be the glottis (throat), and the last place of articulation 
to be the nasal cavity (after the lips at the exterior of the oral cavity).

This is the opposite of the IPA because there, they order the places of articulations starting from the lips going further back
towards the throat.
(This isn't an official ordering of the places of articulations in the IPA, but in charts you often see the lips listed first)

In the TPA, there are about 22 places of articulations and this is subject to change.
The tongue also has its own 4 places of articulations named "Dorsal", "Laminal", "Apical" and "Apical-Subapical".

Sometimes, it is possible to place a different part of the tongue on the same place of articulation.
For example, at the alveolar ridge, which is the frontal ridge of the human palate;
Either the tip of the tongue or the "blade" of the tongue (the area behind the tip of the tongue) may be
placed at the lower side of the alveolar ridge or the upper side of the alveolar ridge.

Thus, this place of articulation is a hotbed of possible sounds to be articulated and is the place of articulation
with the highest number of possible combinations of articulations.

====================================================================================================
THE MANNERS OF ARTICULATIONS:
====================================================================================================
The "Manner of Articulations" are ordered starting from the most restrictive towards the least restrictive phones.
(It is also like that in the IPA, although there is still a difference in the ordering between the TPA and the IPA.)

In the TPA, there are about 14 manners of articulations, they are mainly differentiated by their pathway (oral or nasal), occlusivity(occlusive, strictive, non-strictive), manner (plosive, fricative, nasal etc) and this is subject to change.

====================================================================================================
THE MANNERS OF PRODUCTIONS:
====================================================================================================
The "Manners of Productions" are perhaps unique to the TPA, albeit the IPA does acknowledge the existence of ALL of the
Manners of Productions that the TPA talks of and utilizes.

In the TPA, there are 7 manners of productions. This is NOT subject to change as after extensive research, I do not believe
there can be any other manner of a sound production.

2 of the manners can be either egressive (outwards) or ingressive (inwards), that gives us 4 and 3 that are mono directional.
Which makes 7.

These are:
Pulmonic Egressives (Pulmonics)
Pulmonic Ingressives (Pulmonics)

Glottalic Egressives (Ejectives)
Glottalic Ingressives (Implosives)

Lingual Egressives (Velarics)
Suctional Ingressives (Clicks)

Percussives (articulators only move towards one another)

The pulmonics are sounds that are articulated by either exhaling or inhaling air, the glottis is open during the articulation.

The Glottalics are sounds that are articulated with a CLOSED glottis. Since these sounds are pronounced with a closed glottis
there is no inhaling or exhaling and any kind of a use of the lungs during their production. In fact, a closed glottis
is NECESSARY in order to pronounce glottalics. These still rely on air, however not on inhalation or exhalation but instead on a
a pistoning movement with the glottal structure to push out or suck in the air.

Due to the nature of the glottalics, they CAN NOT BE long in duration, while some pulmonic sounds can be pronounced as much
as the speaker can exhale them out.

The suctionals are sounds that have nothing to do with both the glottis (the throat) as well as the lungs and the inhalation
and the exhalation of air. This is in contrast to the pulmonics and glottalics.

These sounds are articulated solely using suction with the articulatory organs (such as the lips in the kissing sound )

The lingual egressive manner of production also has nothing to do with the throat or the glottis.
In this case, the sounds are articulated by pushing the air out with the tongue.
This also kills the possibility of having a place of articulation that is behind the tongue for the lingual egressives.

Similar to the glottis, the tongue can push the air out or suck the air in.
However, because the tongue is further up in the vocal tract, some of the further back
places of articulations are simply left out of the operation. 

I concluded that the Upper Alveolar part of the mouth is the starting point for the lingual egressives (velarics) and anything
further back than that is not possible to be articulated.

Percussives are sounds that are made by bringing to the two articulators together and making them "hit" one another, thus the
term "percussive".

For example, a bidental percussive is when the upper teeth and the lower teeth are made to hit one another.
Or, a glottal percussives is when the vocal cords ares brought together which seals the glottal opening.
This is what happens in the human body when a person holds their breath.

Here, there isnt an outwardly or an inwardly direction, the direction is simply towards the articulators that are striking one
another.
====================================================================================================
COMPLEXITY:
====================================================================================================
	TPA divides phones into two main categories called "simple phones" and "complex phones".
The simple phones are differentiated from one another based on the criteria of "places of articulation",
the "manners of articulation", phonation (voicing of the vocal cords) (if applicable, 2 distinctions, voiceless and voiced)
as well as the "manner of production". 

For vocoids, they are differentiated based on whether the lips are rounded or not, the position of the tongue (3 positions)
and the lowering of the jaw.

The "complex phones" are simple phones that have an added "secondary articulation" applied on to them.
This secondary articulation can be a co-articulation with another phone or it can be a specific articulatory action within the
vocal tract.
For example, a simple phone may be pronounced at the same time as the tongue being raised up towards the plate.
This secondary articulation is called "palatalization" and this phone would be considered a "complex phone".
====================================================================================================
OCCLUSIVITY:
====================================================================================================
	TPA has an important concept called occlusivity. This concept helps identify which phones are possible to be pronounced.
There are 3 levels of occlusivity in the TPA. These are "occlusive", "strictive" and "non-strictive".

For example, an occlusive phone can not be long in duration and thus, all occlusives are non-continuants.
However, they can be "held" at place, even though they can't be "continued"

Another example, glottalic ingressives (implosives) can only be occlusives, they can not be strictivs or non-strictives.
While, the glottalic egressives CAN be occlusives and strictives but not non-strictives.

"occlusives" are sounds where a complete obstruction is made in the vocal tract (the air can not exit out). (consonants)
"strictives" are sounds where a partial obstruction is made in the vocal tract (the air still exits out). (consonants)
"non-strictives" are sounds where an obstruction is not made in the vocal tract and the sound simply exits out. (vowels)

====================================================================================================
CONTINUANCE:
====================================================================================================s
	This is a term that is used to determine whether a phone can be pronounced in continuation or in just one go.
There are two states here (continuants, non-continuants)
Non-Continuant phones can not be long in duration due to their nature. Although, some of them can be "held" in place.
Making them "look" as if they are long in duration.
====================================================================================================
PHONATION:
====================================================================================================
	A phone can be "voiced" by causing the vocal cords to vibrate during its pronunciation. This is called "voicing".
There are two states here (voiceless and voiced)

For example, glottalic egressives (ejectives) are all voiceless, they can not be voiced.
While, glottalic ingressives (implosives) can be voiceless or voiced.

Any phone where the vocal cords do not vibrate is considered voiceless in the TPA.
Even if the phone has nothing to do with the throat, such as the lingual egressives.
====================================================================================================
THE PHONETIC SYSTEM OF THE TPA:
====================================================================================================
	The different combinations of the places of articulations, manners of articulations, the manners of productions
give us a complete picture of how the phonetic system operates.

This system is based on boolean logic, and I try to ensure its concepts and explanations do not violate boolean logic.

====================================================================================================
INCLUSION OF LETTERS:
====================================================================================================
	Proof of pronunciation is necessary for the inclusion of a phone into the TPA and currently there are over 300 different
simple phones in the TPA.

Each letter has to look distinct from one another in some way and they can not have any free floating diacritics.
(as that is reserved for the combining diacritics for the representation of complex phones)

For example, the IPA letter [i] has been changed to {ɩ} in the TPA. Even though, computationally there isn't a combining
diacritic here. Visually, this diacritic is DETACHED from the letter and thus can not be used in the TPA.
====================================================================================================
PHONETIC, PHONOLOGICAL AND GRAMMATICAL FEATURES:
====================================================================================================
  A vast array of combining diacritics and punctuation marks are provided in the TPA. Not only to indicate phonetic phenomena
but also to indicate and mark phonological as well as grammatical phenomena that may be found in languages.

====================================================================================================
LETTER CASE:
====================================================================================================
	The TPA is made up entirely of small case letters or letters that do not have case. (it is a caseless alphabet)
====================================================================================================
AFFRICATE SYSTEM:
====================================================================================================
	The "affricates" also differ from the IPA to some extent in order to be more accurate and legible.
Firstly, the TPA has specific letters for affricates while the IPA uses 2 letters that are either ligated or are joined
using an orthographic tie bar above or below the letters.

The TPA's definition of affricates:
Affricates (Stop-Strictives) are stops (plosives that are held in place) that are immediately followed by strictives.
The stop and the strictive share the place of articulation and it can not be a seperate place of articulation.

For example, in the Greek language, the contoid cluster [ps] (a bilabial plosive followed by an alveolar fricative) exists.
There is even a specific letter for it called "psi" (Ψ).
This is not an affricate as they do not share a place of articulation. This is a contoid cluster.
(2 seperate contoids without a vowel in between.)

- They cannot have seperate phonations.
For example, a voiced stop followed by a voiceless fricative is not an affricate.
That too, would be a contoid cluster

Although the affricates in the TPA get specific letters, because there may be so many different kinds of affricates, a
combining diacritical tie bar can also be used for full accommodation (the co-articulation diacritic).
==============================================
 CONCLUSION:
 ==============================================
	The TPA is not designed with a specific language in mind.
In fact, it has nothing to do with any language but instead, it is designed based on the mechanisms of the human vocal tract.

The TPA is not designed for use in speech therapy. 
Although it may be used as such.

The TPA is not designed for use in voice recognition technology.
However, it is designed for computational linguistics.
I don't know how well it would fare in that field as I do not have experience with it.

The TPA is not designed for use in conlanging. But, again, it may be used as such.

I believe after months of work I have created a phonetic alphabet that is better than the International Phonetic Alphabet or any
other phonetic notation system.

I successfully use this alphabet with any language and in any linguisic work as a valuable linguistics research tool.

I would like to invite others to also use this alphabet in linguistic research.
