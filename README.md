# Translingual Phonetic Alphabet

The Translingual Phonetic Alphabet (**TPA**) is a phonetic alphabet that is based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (**IPA**).

I created the **TPA** because I found the **IPA** to be too inaccurate, illegible, computer incompatible and inextensive.

I wanted to create an alphabet that was more logical, more legible, more aesthetically pleasing and computer compatible.
Thus, the TPA is a complete unicode phonetic alphabet that is suitable to be used with computers.

The **IPA** has complete representation in **Unicode**.

**ABOUT:**
I created this alphabet after having taken a break from the study of phonetics in order to study computer programming.
There, I learned of the importance of logical thinking, as computer programs do not work if you do not follow logic.

After having understood the concept of logic, I came back to phonetics and now I was able to have a deeper understanding
of the subject. For example, I did not understand how ejective consonants were pronounced. Even though I read articles
which said that there were such consonant sounds and viewed a video clip where someone was pronouncing them correctly.
I myself was unable to pronounce them, nor did I know how to. However, I finally figured out how, many different
sounds are pronounced in the human vocal tract and I proceeded to categorize them and I created my own phonetic alphabet.

In this repository, you can find some LibreOffice (**.ods**) and Portable Document Format (**.pdf**) document files as well as other files
that document the letters of the Translingual Phonetic Alphabet and its combining diacritics and other graphical markings
with information and audio files.

The alphabet has come to a usable point after version 2 and it was greatly improved since then as well.
I am not planning to work on this alphabet further into my thirties as I think it is already advanced and it is working really well.

These spreadsheet files can also be opened in Microsoft Excel.\
(Note: some of the code that the spreadsheets use may not work there.)

If you are looking for a good, capable font that can display all of the letters of the **TPA**.\
I highly suggest that you download the font called **Code2000** and use it on any **TPA** phonetic transcription.

I can not guarantee that the letters of the TPA will show correctly in any other font as I am testing the alphabet on the use
of this font, however other fonts may also give satisfactory results.

I am not the author of this font, but I am hosting it here as I can not find this font anywhere else.\

Also, as of version 3.2 a keyboard typeable method has been uploaded and is being developed.\

**Thanks for your interest in the TPA, feel free to raise any issues on the Issues page here:**\

Also of note, I have written a "scientific literary work" on the subject of Articulatory Phonetics:\

*"GitHub" is where I aim to host the entirety of the project in its electronic format forever unless otherwise.
I will not be creating a print form of this project as I find no need to do so, but I do not object to that notion otherwise.*
