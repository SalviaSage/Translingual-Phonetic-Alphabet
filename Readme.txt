This is the version 1.0 of the keyboard typeable method for the TPA.

It is quite rudimentary at this point but it will show a blue keyboard icon on the system tray when it is not active.

To activate it, press ctrl+alt+t , then the keyboard icon will turn into a tree icon and you can type this alphabet for phonetic notation.

To disable it and type normally, press ctrl+alt+t again.


- The numpad keys have the combining diacritics.
- The F1-F12 keys have the additional vowel characters.
- Also, This layout is based on the QWERTY keyboard layout, I may make other layouts in the future.

- It uses ctrl, alt and shift modifier keys combined with the letters to type extra letters.

Also, you can run the .ahk directly if you have the AutoHotkey programming language installed on your computer.
