##### FOREWORD:

I am the creator of the Translingual Phonetic Alphabet (TPA). In this work, I discuss why I created this alphabet, what it is for and in what ways it is useful and how it can be used.

I studied the subject of articulatory phonetics for years. I studied the articles that others had written on the subject. I studied the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and its concepts. I also studied the works by the Italian phonetician Luciano Canepari. However, soon enough, my knowledge on the subject matter had surpassed that of the textbooks and what was covered in the IPA. I started to see flaws in the IPA and I got the idea to create a new phonetic alphabet and do original research. I completed both of those projects and I wrote a dissertation (Independent Explanations on Articulatory Phonetics) on that matter and I created a new phonetic alphabet of my own which I named "The Translingual Phonetic Alphabet".

Independent Explanations on Articulatory Phonetics:  
https://gist.github.com/SalviaSage/1e7671e4cec5044a88398cce24c57abf

That work along with this one here is supposed to constitute some kind of a scientific *magnum opus* (great work) for me. In my other work (Independent Explanations on Articulatory Phonetics), I explain how speech works technically in a very verbose and a detailed manner. However, in this work, I want to show more real language examples on how to make phonetic transcriptions and give detailed information on how to use the Translingual Phonetic Alphabet.

The way I saw it, the IPA just wasnʼt good enough. A phonetic alphabet is a linguistic tool. It allows us to make phonetic transcriptions of words in any language and represent how they are pronounced accurately. It is a tool that, if used correctly, can clear up the ambiguities as to how words are pronounced in different languages. It can also be an important study tool in language studies and it can help with learning foreign languages.

Developing a phonetic alphabet, however, is difficult. I can say it took me months, but not years to develop the alphabet and to develop its contents. It took me additional time and effort to try to polish it and standardise it. It was first based on the IPA, then I changed things as I saw fit. I particularly had difficulty establishing its vowel system, which is radically different than that of the IPA’s. However, finally, I established a system that does work.

In order to demonstrate why a phonetic alphabet is important in linguistics and to try to convince you further of its importance, we shall look at this Russian word example: How do you pronounce the word "конечно"? If you have learned how to read the Cyrillic alphabet, you may proceed to read it as "konechno". However, your pronunciation will not be correct, even though you read the letters correctly. Because, here, that first 'о' as well as the last 'о' is pronounced as an 'a' instead. That is, it does not have labial rounding as the spelling shows. But, you learned that this letter is an 'o' when you learned the alphabet. Well, they didn't tell you the whole picture. The fact is, in Russian, just like in English, there is a stress pattern whereby at least one syllable is stressed in all words. And in this case, it happens to be the second, middle syllable. Well, that very fact with regards to syllable stress "converts" those unstressed 'о' letters into an 'a' pronunciation. The spelling just doesn't show this. This is called vowel reduction and in many languages, vowel reduction is not marked in writing, including English, Hindi, Russian and German. Furthermore, that 'ч' letter that you learned to pronounce as the first sound in "chair" is being pronounced as if it is the letter 'ш', the first sound in "sheep" and the letter 'e' palatalises the preceding letter 'н'. Sometimes their schemes are predictable and can be guessed, but sometimes they are not. Usually, as people improve their knowledge on the subject matter, they figure out the correct pronunciations and can guess them based on the way the words are spelled. This is where phonetics and phonology come into the picture. The correct pronunciation is in fact "kanyeshna", of course you may already know this if you speak Russian. But thatʼs the whole point, you donʼt! Also of note, here, we wrote "kanyeshna" as the correct pronunciation. But to be more precise, the 'n' and the 'y' is in fact pronounced at the same time and not successively. Using normal orthography, we canʼt write this this but we can write it using extended orthography such as by using a combining tie bar ( ͜   ) "kan͜yeshna". However, we can see that a digraph is being used here with the letters (s) and (h) when in fact none of those two letters are assigned the sound that we are looking for. Again, we have to resort to finding additional letters such as [ ʃ ] from the International Phonetic Alphabet or { ş } from the Translingual Phonetic Alphabet which then gives us "kan͜yeşna" which is exactly the way to write how this word is pronounced. Let us compare them now, "конечно" in the Cyrillic alphabet and "`kan͜yeşna" in the Translingual Phonetic Alphabet. Our way of spelling is just more accurate than the standard spelling with regards to showing how words are pronounced.

In another example, let’s look at the Chinese character "得" which is pronounced something like { dəo꜊꜈ } but the logograph Chinese character (hanzi) is not letting you know any hints as to how the word is supposed to be pronounced. It does however tell you the meaning of the word. So, although you may be able to understand the meaning of the word (to get; to obtain; to gain, to acquire, (wiktionary.org)) you would not know how to pronounce the word at all. Unless of course, if you also actually knew or studied that language.

In the first scenario we had limited information with regards to how a word is supposed to be pronounced while in the latter we had no information with regards to how the word is supposed to be pronounced but instead we were given the words semantic meaning as it is the case with Chinese writing. So, we can say that logographic writing is on one end of the scale which gives us no information on pronunciation while phonetic writing is on the other end of the scale which tries to give us full information as to how a word is pronounced. We already know that no language is written phonetically and neither do they try to. They do not make spelling reforms to conform to the way words are pronounced. So, why is it like that? Let me answer this question for you: This is because a language, primarily, refers to spoken and historical language. Writing and spelling is only secondary to that spoken or "existing" language. It needs a system that works and that system does not at all have to be phonetic and often it isnʼt. In fact, it is sometimes argued that phonetic spelling is worse for languages, which is something that I also agree with, even though I am a phonetician. These languages have long established traditions of writing that simply can not be thrown out in favour of a phonetic writing. The reason why "knife" is spelled with a 'k' is because there actually was a pronounced 'k' in the past while since, it has been dropped. It is the same scenario with French language words that are spelled with the letter 'H'. Even though, today, the sound associated with this letter does not even exist in the French language. They are there for historical reasons. When someone attempts to change the way words are spelled, this is called a spelling reform. However, often times these attempts are fruitless as world languages already have well established writing systems. However, they were not as well established or standardised in the past.

So then, is there a way to spell out words phonetically? Yes, there is. The most famous attempt of this is of course the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). However, I found it odd that there is only one such phonetic alphabet of its kind. Considering that there are many programming languages, real world languages and different alphabets and different writing systems around the world; it is indeed odd that we have just one phonetic alphabet of its kind. I saw a gap in our scientific knowledge here and I thought that there should be another phonetic notation system and that I should try and make a new phonetic alphabet.

I gave this project the title "The Translingual Phonetic Alphabet". The project quickly grew out of its proportions and it is now not only an excellent phonetic alphabet but it also tries to be a complete linguistics research and study tool. It includes ways to represent grammatical phenomena, phonological phenomena and typography. It is very modern and it is racing to keep up with technological advancements in computational linguistics. I personally believe that I did the world a favor and that I advanced the scientific subjects of articulatory phonetics and of phonetic notation in computers by myself. Although my peers and others may disagree with me, I continue to hold on to my belief and I am proud of my scientific works. In this work, I want to try to prove myself by giving further examples and details as to how this new phonetic alphabet can be used.

#### CHAPTER ONE (Ⅰ): The Differences Between the IPA and the TPA:

In this chapter I want to go into very detailed and verbose commentary on some of the differences and comparisons between the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and the Translingual Phonetic Alphabet (TPA).

Basically, there are twenty vowels in the TPA and up to about two hundred consonants if we count all the possible consonants. A good number of these consonants are not found in world languages. They have to be included for accuracy and completion. Things are further complicated by the existence of "secondary articulations" whereby another pronunciation or motion is utilised at the same time. That gives us many different combinations of sounds which can perhaps be hundreds of different combinations. There isnʼt a clear cut line between the vowels and consonants and all the sounds are basically a continuation in a complete package. I believe it is a serious error to separate the vowel sounds and consonant sounds as if they are two separate things. Phonetically, they are not, and it should not be considered as such. Although, *phonologically*, I do admit that they can be different.

The aim of this project is to be able to represent, write and type all sounds as they are found in human languages and also, all sounds that can possibly be articulated by the human anatomy regardless of language. Thus, if done right, we would have a very complete alphabet and a writing system with which any utterance can be written down and typed electronically with full precision. I personally believe that my alphabet is superior to the IPA and yet, it is as simple to comprehend and to use as the IPA.

This alphabet aims to be very accurate. It was important to me that the alphabet was accurate and factual. That it took into account anything of concern, such as the orthography of world languages, the anatomical structure of the human vocal tract, the phonology of world languages and anything else that was of relevance.

The IPA violates its own principle of having a single letter for a single sound. For example, in the IPA, two separate letters are used for the affricate sounds. An example of this is the letter for the "voiceless postalveolar affricate" ( t͡ʃ , ͜tʃ , tʃ and the ligature ʧ ). This letter, which is written with two letters in the IPA represents the first sound found in the English word "chair". Not only is using two letters (a digraph) for one single sound is bad enough; there are four different ways to write/type them. In the TPA, we have single letters for affricate sounds, although the two letter notation is still valid. This letter in the TPA is { ɕ } (U+0286). It is the letter "c" with a curl added to it at the bottom. I found this letter in Unicode and named it "etch". I then went ahead and created the "edg" { ʓ } (U+0293) following the same scheme. The IPA aims to give specific letters to specific manners and places of articulations and yet the affricates are one area where they fail to do that. I went ahead and created new letters to fill in this gap. This also results in easier writing / typing and better aesthetics.

On the contrary, I have heard arguments from others saying that IPA has a better representation since affricates are stop-strictives and that since they are two separate sounds being pronounced at the same time, they don’t need their own characters. That argument itself is valid and writing affricates as such isnʼt invalid. But, I think it is easier to have specific characters and that they should be there and I give the user that choice.

Another area where the IPA fails in having a specific letter for a specific place/manner of articulation is that they use combining diacritics below or above already existing letters to make new letters. This is something we don’t do in the TPA. Instead, I searched the repertoire of Unicode to find fitting letters for every single different place of articulation and manner of articulation. I believe the reason why IPA does this is because there are simply too many places of articulations and manners of articulations to have enough letters. I myself ran into the same situation, but I am more lucky because instead of resorting to flipping existing letters upside down, I have with me Unicode version fifteen as of now (as of the year 2023). I was able to find just enough variations of letters to fill in all of the manners of articulations and places of articulations. Thus, the TPA has specific letters for every single place of articulation and manner of articulation. For example, the IPA and the TPA both have the letter 't' for the "voiceless alveolar plosive". Then, the IPA has the letter [t̪] for the "voiceless dental plosive" while the TPA takes the small capital 't', the letter 'ᴛ' and places it at the position of this place of articulation. Same with 'd' and 'ᴅ'. Then, it also adds 'ȶ' and 'ȡ', the letters t and d with curl and assigns them to the "alveolo-palatal" or "postalveolar" position where the IPA actually lacks these "non-official" letters. They are mentioned in literature and are existing letters similar to the IPA letters [ɕ] and [ʑ]. They are valid and easily pronounced sounds but they are just not included in the IPA.

A note on computational linguistics; If we had to count the number of sounds (phones) a word has with a computer program, the IPA could be giving us a higher phone count than what we should be getting. I did not run into this problem but I know that the TPA is also more computer friendly, simply because it tries its best to have a single sound, single letter approach, regardless of how many secondary or tertiary articulations are being thrown into it. In certain cases, due to not having letters, I have to use arrow markers next to the letters such as { ɕ↑ } for example. But, in these scenarios, I can use an optional tie bar to show that we have just one sound. Technically, everything that can be written without a tie-bar is just a single sound.

In the IPA, on its Wikipedia page, there are 33 vowel letters. Furthermore, it does not take into account that semi-vowels could also be realised as vowels in world languages and typically they are not included in the vowel chart of the IPA. This is a grave mistake. Those 4 semi-vowels in fact, form the foundation from where the vowels must be measured from. Compared to the 30+ vowels of the IPA, we only have 20 vowels plus 4 semi-vowels (approximants) in the TPA. And yet, despite the lower number of vowels, all the vowels in the TPA are demonstrated orthographically, phonetically and phonologically in world languages while the vowels in the IPA simply donʼt have the evidence for themselves. Due to the structure of the human mouth, there can not be that many vowels and no language makes orthographic or phonological distinctions between such vowels either. Thirty-three vowels is simply too much. Considering the Arabic language has only about three vowels and the Turkish language has about eight vowels and English has maybe over ten vowels and so on and so forth.

Let me demonstrate this further. In the Greek alphabet, we have the letters "o mikron, ' Ο ' and o mega, ' Ω ' ". They mean "small o" and "big o". So, we can see that possibly, a laxity distinction (that the jaw is lower down) is being made here between those two letters. We see the same thing in the Devanagari alphabet where we see the vowel letters ' ओ ' and ' औ '. So, it is up to us to explain what kind of a sound difference there is between these letters, and what sounds they represent. For the layman, it may seem like they are just the same vowels or that they are pronounced the same. But then, why are there two separate letters? The explanation is in fact very simple. If the distinction is in laxity, that is, that the jaw is lower down during the pronunciation of both ' Ω ' and ' औ ', then we know in our phonetic alphabet we need to have such a 2 way distinction and both the IPA and the TPA account for this with the samely used letters 'o' and 'ɔ'. However, the problem here is that the IPA further makes the argument that there is another level of laxity that is more open than our 'ɔ' with the letter 'ɒ'. I believe this is simply false and superfluous. No language makes such a distinction, not orthographically and not phonologically. Human beings simply donʼt lower down their jaws that much in order to pronounce vowels. That is why in the TPA we have 4 levels of laxity (openness) plus the base consonantal level, the semi-vowels. I call the semi-vowels or the approximants, level 0, which give us 5 levels of laxity in total. This is in comparison with the absurd 7 level system which is found in the IPA which I believe is wrong.

I have to underline it again. It is very important to have the semi-vowels, also known as approximants as a base level in order to have an accurate explanation of vowels. This is the stage from where the vowels must be measured from. The IPA simply does not account for that.

Furthermore, in the TPA, we only make a two level distinction of tongue positions for close vowels while we have a three level distinction for open vowels. The explanation for this is simple. In the open vowels, because the jaw is lower down, the tongue has more room to move back and forth and indeed an audible difference and an articulatory difference exists between those three tongue positions, named as front, centre and rear.

Now, I will try to prove in what ways the IPA is wrong with regards to the vowels with demonstrations from world languages. The Arabic language, surprisingly, does not have an open front vowel, 'e' or an open back vowel, 'a'. Phonologically, instead, we only have a central open vowel that is represented by the vowel 'æ' in the IPA and also in the TPA. Arabic only has three vowels which is odd since most languages have five or more. Although the IPA wrongfully considers the vowel, represented by the letter 'æ' to be a front vowel, it is in fact a central open vowel. Historically, English and Icelandic also made this distinction and had the same letter 'æ' as it is also used in the IPA. We can see that this letter is a combination of the letters 'a' and 'e'. We already know that 'a' represents a tongue back, lips unrounded and jaw open (lowered down), while 'e' is the same thing but with the tongue advanced forwards all the way. Exactly… the ancients knew that this was a sound that fell half way between the sounds represented by those two letters, hence 'æ'. However, the IPA has wrongfully classified this legitimate vowel sound as a front vowel, as can be seen in this IPA vowel chart:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_vowel_chart_with_audio  
Here, you can also see that the labially rounded version of this vowel is missing, which makes no sense. It does not make sense, because technically, all of these vowels can also be labially rounded or labially unrounded. Thus I went and added its rounded counterpart which is appropriately represented by the letter 'œ'. There are seven vowels on that chart that also do not have their rounded or unrounded counterparts. This further show us the wrongs of the alphabet and its logical fallacy with regards to the vowels.

While that is the case with open vowels, we see no kind of a three way distinction of tongue positions with close vowels. We do not see it orthographically or phonologically in languages. While we do see it in the IPA. I believe they are trying to be unnecessarily accurate here or that they are wrong. This will also confuse students. Thus I make a two way distinction for the position of the tongue for close vowels. Yes, the English reduced vowel "schwa" is not as backwards in the position of the tongue as the vowel in the pronunciation of the Turkish vowel 'ı'. But, it is not as close (jaw up, teeth touching) as that vowel either. The Turkish vowel is a close back vowel while the English schwa is a near-close back vowel. We already know that the second level and the fourth levels of the vowels are necessary and we have proof to include them. Again, another example is the Vietnamese letter 'o' with the horn diacritic ( ơ ). This also represents the schwa sound. Basically, if the schwa vowel were to be even more open, it would become the 'a' vowel. I know it is a delicate balance between vowel openness and tongue position, but this system of 5 levels of vowel openness (vowel laxity), with the first three making a front-back distinction while the last two making a front-center-back distinction is the most accurate way I could make this vowel system and it wasnʼt easy. What is so fascinating here is the way all the vowels relate to one another and are rather exactly at the positions that they should be. I believe they are very accurate with regards to the human mouth and are fully compatible for use with world languages.

In this IPA vowel chart (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_vowel_chart_with_audio), you can see that the graph that is being used is incorrectly becoming wider as the mouth is more closed. This is wrong because there is less room for the tongue to be advanced and retracted as the jaw is higher up. I am making the claim that that graph is wrong and that it is upside down.

Thus the TPA has a remarkable, factual, 20 vowel + 4 semi vowel system that is so easy to understand and simple. It is also fully capable of explaining phonological concepts as they relate to vowels. So, not only does it work phonetically, it works phonologically and orthographically as well.

|    ᴀ | ɔ       |      ᴁ | ɶ       |     ᴇ | ꬿ       |

Here, I posted a crude example of what the letters and the vowel system of the TPA.

Also of note is the IPA’s 5 level tone system while I have a 3 level tone system. Basically, there, they are trying to be unnecessarily accurate with regards to tones. There is a 7 level tone system in music. But in phonetics, 5 levels may be too much. I think simply having a low tone, a mid tone and a high tone does the job. I am also aware of “shifting”, “gliding” or “contour tones”, which all deal with tone shift during the pronunciation of vowels. I then went and found some combining diacritics from Unicode to show the tones and the changing tones as well. I believe tonal languages such as Vietnamese, Thai and Chinese languages can be written really well with the TPA. Its system is so similar to and in fact the same as that of Pinyin. But it goes a step further and tries to be more accurate and account for things that aren’t just in Mandarin Chinese. Basically, the three tones can shift from mid to high, low to high, mid to high, high to mid, high to low and so on. All of the combinations are valid and there are multiple ways to mark it orthographically in Unicode. This gives us 3 flat tones, 6 double contour tones and 10 triple contour tones. We can basically choose which one we want to use for representation and it is a very complete system for writing tones. It is very similar to the system in Pinyin and in fact, it uses the same combining diacritics as Pinyin. Although I did not copy Pinyin, it does have better tonal representation than Pinyin in the sense that it supports triple contour tones and all of the combinations of the shifting tones.

If further precision is needed, the low tone can be separated into two called extra low and the high tone can be extra high. However, in this case, the mid tone always remains the same and is measured from there. 3-5-7 Here, it is a matter of precision.

| FLAT TONES | DOUBLE CONTOUR TONES | TRIPLE CONTOUR TONES |
| :--------: | :------------------: | :------------------: |
|    LOW     |      LOW - MID       |   LOW - MID - LOW    |
|    MID     |      LOW - HIGH      |   LOW - HIGH- LOW    |
|    HIGH    |      MID - LOW       |   LOW - HIGH - MID   |
|            |      MID - HIGH      |   MID - LOW - MID    |
|            |      HIGH - LOW      |   MID - LOW - HIGH   |
|            |      HIGH - MID      |   MID - HIGH - LOW   |
|            |                      |   MID - HIGH - MID   |
|            |                      |   HIGH - LOW - MID   |
|            |                      |  HIGH - LOW - HIGH   |
|            |                      |  HIGH - MID - HIGH   |

#### CHAPTER TWO (Ⅱ): TPA Design Goals:

- **Caseless alphabet:** The TPA does not have a case distinction just like many other alphabets. It is in fact a small case Latin alphabet and intentionally excludes all capital case letters in favour of small case letters. Although, some of its letters are bigger in size and have the glyphs of capital letters.

- **Phonetic accuracy:** I tried to measure out the vocal tract and place all the sounds and the letters in relation to each other. I tried to make the alphabet millimetrically accurate with regards to the structure of the vocal tract and the tongue. I am amazed at how accurate the alphabet turned out to be.

- **Complementing the IPA:** I know that the IPA will possibly be forever more popular than the TPA. No matter if the TPA is better. Thus it is not my aim to "beat" the IPA or to be more popular than the IPA. The TPA however tries to be a complete and a superior alternative to the IPA and to complement the IPA in any and all circumstances where it is not favored by authors. I personally no longer use the IPA, I also have a way to type the TPA on the keyboard.

- **Font compliancy:** The TPA is not bound to a specific font and neither does it try to be. However, because the TPA uses so many different combining diacritics and letters and the fact that these combining diacritics can then be used on a letter which already has combining diacritics makes it so that some letters will not display correctly on some fonts. The fact is, there can not be a perfect font for the TPA and no font is perfect. Obviously we donʼt have this problem if we are writing with a pen and paper, but on computers this problem is not avoidable. I think the issue can be better addressed by developing and testing more fonts that are more friendly to those features. I have found however that certain fonts do work better in displaying the characters and the combining diacritics of the TPA. These fonts are namely the "Brill" font and the "Code2000" font. The "Andika" font developed by the SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics) also seems good. However, no font is perfect. There is also of course the notion of font development specific to the TPA and font makers are known to develop fonts aiming at specific scripts. I however, have not developed any fonts and I want to express my gratitude to those who did.

- **Unicode compliancy:** The TPA is entirely based on the characters of the Unicode. For computer compatibility, it can not go outside of that scope. Obviously, we donʼt have this problem if we write by using a pen and paper. But our project is a Unicode phonetic alphabet and computer typing is crucial. That is to say, there are no characters, diacritics or punctuation marks that are outside of Unicode in the TPA.

- **Use of combining diacritics:** In order to solve the aforementioned problem of having "one letter per sound", the TPA resorts to using combining diacritics that are added on top of or below the base letters. The official practice is to place all phonetic articulations such as secondary articulations on top of the letters while placing phonological markers below the letters. It is also allowed to place a second or a third diacritic below or above the letters if need be and I know this may cause problems with fonts and displays on computers, but this gives us greater options.

- **Use of other mainstream orthography:** The TPA does not throw out the general orthography and other writing guidelines that writing systems use. For example, although we donʼt have capitalisation because TPA is entirely small case letters, we can still use things like question marks, commas and things of that sort. They donʼt affect the phonetic alphabet, and in fact the TPA has these markers in order to mark even more grammatical and semantic phenomena as it is found in languages. For example, although in typical orthography, you may have commas to separate phrases, and periods to separate sentences, you do not have separators for morphemes or for vowel hiatus which would be of use to us here.

- **The coining of new phonetic letters for affricates:** Although this wasnʼt originally planned, I saw that the IPA did not have specific letters for affricates. I thought there should be such new letters. I adored the letters "esh" { ʃ } and "ezh" { ʒ } from the IPA and I knew that these letters were so beneficial and were so necessary but it was sad to see that their affricate counterparts, which are also popular sounds in world languages were not there. So I went ahead and found two appropriate letters from Unicode that I called "etch" { ʆ } and "edg" { ʓ }. They are basically the esh and the ezh letters with a curl at the bottom. I also found "ets" { ꞩ } and "edz" { ƶ }. They are the s and the z letters with a stroke going through them which show the affricate versions of those fricative sounds in the TPA. As well as { ȼ } for palatal affricate which is letter 'c' with stroke. Keeping up with the curled and the stroke letters the velar affricate { ꝁ } and the uvular affricate { ꝗ } as well as a curled v for a voiced labiodental affricate { ⱴ } and a "p with stroke through descender" { ꝑ } for the bilabial affricate if need be, although they are rarer sounds.

- **Stress markers:** The IPA Marks stress outside of letters by using marks such as [ ˈ ] and [ ˌ ] but there is a problem here. They will unnecessarily add to the character count as well as make the text look less legible. It can also be confusing as to where these characters would be placed, but we know that the central part of a syllable, the nucleus of the syllable is the area that would be stressed. This is typically the vowel. So I made the design decision to simply draw a bar under a letter to mark stress such as: { a̱ } and if you want to make a distinction between primary stress and secondary stress, you can add an additional bar such as { a̱̱ }, then, that would be the primary stress and { a̱ } would be the secondary stress. That aside, I do like the syllabification and the markers used by the IPA in general.

- **The use of superscripts and 'small caps' letters:** In the IPA, the superscript letters are used to mark secondary articulations. That original practice from the IPA by using the superscript letters is not present in the TPA. Some small caps letters represent different letters in the TPA. for example, d and ᴅ, t and ᴛ, b and ʙ and so on.

- **The prohibition of the use of illogical characters:** Whatever isnʼt phonetically, mechanically possible shouldnʼt be used. For example, the ejective diacritic should not be used with any voiced character such as {d↑}. Since the 'd' is voiced and all ejectives are voiceless, this is a logical error and such logical errors should be avoided. Also, for example, using the nasalisation diacritic with letters such as '{ m̃ }' and '{ ñ } since they are already nasal characters. It makes no sense to use the labial rounding character on something that is already rounded such as { ů }. It is also a logical error to tie together voiced and voiceless letters such as {d͡p}, they can not be voiceless and voiced at the same time.

- **Keyboard typing:** I would like it so that there is a way to type the TPA letters and symbols on the Android smartphone as well as on the Windows computer and other platforms. I have already devised a way to type it on the Windows computer but I do not know how to do this on the smartphone. That just makes things that much easier. However, due to the high number of letters, it will never be a perfect system nor will it be possible to type it very fast such as how we type in English. Regardless, I am interested in developing easy and capable ways to type this alphabet and have already done so.

- **The use of color coding:** Furthermore, it is an interesting idea to be able to color code some of the segments of our writing, such as, letʼs say, marking adjective words with a certain color, and noun words with a certain color. Perhaps some computer programs can allow us to do that.

- **The use of letters without detached graphical segments:** If you look at the IPA, you can see letters such as 'i' and 'j'. In the TPA, we also have those letters but as 'ı' and 'ȷ'. I removed the tittle (the dot above the letters) because it interferes with the TPAs combining diacritics. Thus, all of our letters in the TPA can be written as single segments. The use of these dotted letters however, still, do not constitute a mistake if you still want to use those versions. They are not assigned to other positions intentionally.

- **The use of pre-composed letters as opposed to single letters + diacritic:** There are letters in the Unicode that are pre-composed such as an é that stands by itself as a single, specific character. This letter actually has the diacritic as a part of it, that is to say, programmatically, the diacritic isnʼt combined with the letter. Our practice in TPA is that we use the combining diacritics on top of the base letters and not the precomposed letters. Although, not doing so would probably not be a problem.

- **Orthographical Compliancy:** One wonderful thing about the TPA is just how well it works with all orthographies, alphabets and writing systems of world languages. I aim to make it so that the TPA has a specific letter for every different letter of world orthographies for compliancy. For example, in Greek there is the “o mikron” and the “o mega”. If it is as such, then the ancients must have considered the “o mega” to be a more open “o”. It may not necessarily be pronounced that way today in modern Greek, as I believe it isn’t. But yet, orthographically we can still account for that in the TPA and do so. This is also the same with the Devanagari letters “ओ” and “औ”. As an example for consonants, Tamil, reportedly, according to the Wikipedia.org webpage, has 6 letters for different nasal consonants. All of those letters are already in the TPA. The TPA has 10 nasal consonant letters, each of which looks different than the other while at the same time looking similar to each other in some way. It also fully supports every single letter in the Devanagari alphabet and other alphabets.

#### CHAPTER THREE (Ⅲ): How to use the TPA Phonetic Markers:

Transcribe orthographical texts either by hand or digitally using word processors or text editors.

Mark orthographic notation (the way the words are actually spelled in a given language) using angle brackets ⟨ text ⟩ or < text >. This is the same practice as most IPA transcriptionists. Mark phonemic writing using the "square bracket with quill" ⁅ text ⁆ (U+2045 , U+2046). This is a special circumstance where we are making a differentiation between phonetic notation and phonemic notation. You can kind of think of phonetic notation as a more precise form of phonemic notation. That is, phonetic notation would always be either the same precision or more precise than phonemic notation. Mark phonetic notation using curly brackets { text } . Mark precise phonetic notation using double curly brackets {{ text }} . The IPA doesnʼt have precise phonetic notation but they also seem to make a distinction between phonemic notation, using the slashes /text/ and phonetic notation using square brackets [text] . I deliberately avoided using the slashes and the square brackets. And that way, in a piece of text, letʼs say you could have IPA notation as well as TPA notation in there without confusing them. But, otherwise, the same markings in the IPA can also be used or it is in the discretion of the writer.

For example:< congratulations > {koŋgɻæ̱ʓ͡yule̱yşəns}

Use at least 1.5 line spacing or even 2 points of line spacing on lines where the transcriptions are, in order to accommodate the below combining and the above combining diacritics of the TPA. What I am saying is, these diacritics can take up some vertical space.

Mark long vowels using the ( ː ), “modifier letter triangular colon (U+02D0)”. Example: < food > { fuːd }

Mark extra long length using two triangular colons ( ːː ).
Some languages may make this distinction.
Example: { uːː }

##### Writing long consonants (gemination) in the TPA: {◌◌}, {◌̄}, {tt} {t̄}, {ss} {s̄}, {ff} {f̄}

Use two of the consonant letters to mark long consonants (gemination) or a macron above.
Example Word: ⟨unnecessary⟩ = { anne̱səsæɻɪ } the letter 'n' here is doubled to show the long consonant, also known in linguistics as gemination. The 's' is not, because it is pronounced short. The IPA on the other hand also uses the vowel length triangular colon to mark gemination [anːe̱səsæɻɪ]. But, I am opting for double letters as I believe it is better aesthetically.

Example long affricate, Hindi language: ⟨ अच्छा ⟩ = { aɕɕa } / { aɕ̄a } (TPA) | ⟨ अच्छा ⟩ = [ at͡ʃːa] (IPA)
Example long plosive, Turkish language: ⟨ tuttuğunu ⟩ = { tuttuɰunu̱ } (TPA) | ⟨ tuttuğunu ⟩ = [ tutːuɰuˈnu ] (IPA)
Example long plosive, Turkish language: ⟨ tuttuğunu ⟩ = {{ t̊ut̊tuɰ̊unu̱ }} (TPA Precise, showing labial rounding)

The little ring diacritic on top of the letters is the TPA diacritic which shows labial rounding as a secondary articulation.
This is because in precise phonetic transcriptions, we try to account for all phonetic phenomena that we think is there, using the full repertoire of the TPA.

Also, by marking the stress using a combining diacritic instead of a separate mark (see above example, the line under the vowels), we are saving a single letter length as well as adding to legibility.

This also helps avoid the ambiguity as to where the stress marker should be placed as it is almost always the vocoids that would receive this mark.
It is also okay to use the stress diacritic for contoid letters if need be, although it seems like this is is usually not necessary, but it is valid otherwise.

Also, actually having two ways to write it gives us more options. You can do things like use the double letter notation under certain circumstances and use the lengthening marker under other circumstances.

Compare TPA { aa } { aɕ͓ͪɕ͓ͪaː } versus IPA [ at͡ʃʰːa ].
Ours is just so much more legible. I am proud of the fact that I have created a more legible phonetic alphabet. The IPA is quite illegible in my opinion.

##### Writing long vowels in the TPA: {◌ː}, {◌ːː}

Example long vowel, English language: ⟨ feet ⟩ = { fɪ̱ːt } (TPA) | ⟨ feet ⟩ = [ fɪ̱ːt ] (IPA)
Example vowel hiatus, Turkish language: ⟨ saat ⟩ = { saa̱t } (TPA) | ⟨ saat ⟩ = [ saˈat ] (IPA)

The important thing to understand is that hiatuses should always be written as two separate letters while long vowels as one letter followed by the duration mark. This is because we actually have two separate vowels here instead of one long vowel and the IPA also correctly accounts for this as seen above.

Phonetic spelling transcription should be written below the orthographic spelling or next to words in phonetic spelling brackets.
Example: [1:3] Then God said, “Let there be light.”; and there was light.
{ ðen ɡad sæd, "let ðeɻ bɪ¬ layt"; æn ðeɻ waz layt. }

Unlike the IPA, we just have three markers, short {◌}, long {◌ː} and extra long {◌ːː}. You can certainly do extra extra long vowels if you want, {◌ːːː}.
IPA has markers like extra short and some other ones, but I think they are just not necessary.

##### Writing hiatus and syllabification (vowel break): {◌·◌}

You just need to place (·) between the two vowels such as (a·i).
Letʼs look at this Turkish language word example:
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%C5%9Fair

Pronunciation
IPA(key): [ʃɑːir]
Hyphenation: şa·ir

This information here is correct. The problem here with this phenomenon is that, if we do not place this dot between the two letters, we would assume that we have a diphthong here. That is, we do not have two short vowels but instead we have one gliding vowel. However, if we are dealing with same vowels such as in this example (aa) or (ii) then we do not need to place a vertical bar between them and it is redundant to do so. Because in this case, we already know that they are separate vowels and that they are not diphthongs. If they were long vowels, it would have the long vowel marker {◌ː} and if it were a diphthong, it would have two different vowel letters.

##### Writing morphological boundaries: {◌•◌}

Preferred use is the bullet character.

##### Writing diphthongs: {◌◌}, {◌͡◌}, {◌͜◌} / Writing triphthongs: {◌◌◌}, {◌͡◌͡◌}, {◌͜◌͜◌}

Diphthongs are simply when two different vowels are pronounced in a single vowel segment. We start at the pronunciation of a vowel and glide towards the other one in a single segment. There is also the phenomenon of saying two different vowels separately which is called a "hiatus" which is discussed here. They can be optionally linked to each other using a tie bar. This way there can be no ambiguity whether we have diphthongs or separate vowels. They count as one vowel segment along with triphthongs. Although, triphthongs are rare and not all languages have diphthongs.

##### Writing rounded front vowels in the TPA: { ◌ }

Actually, I didnʼt have enough appropriate looking characters for this set of vowels. So, I took the rear vowels and I put slashes through them to make front rounded vowels out of the back rounded vowels. Such as:

Rear / Front
u / ʉ
ʊ / ᵿ
o / ø
ɔ / ꬿ

Luckily, these are all precomposed letters as I could just grab them from the Unicode.

The barred versions are good in the sense that they give us a way to type the letters without any combining diacritics on top. German for example, resorts to using the umlaut (◌̈) diacritic to make front vowels out of back vowels. We can not do that here because of the reservation of the space above and below letters.

##### Alternative Letters in the TPA:

- `{ ʃ / ş }` — "esh" and "s cedilla". They both represent the voiceless postalveolar fricative in the TPA. The first sound in "sheep". I introduced this letter, copying it from Turkish for aesthetics. I personally think it looks better than esh [ ʃ ].
    'ş' is the preferred letter in the TPA.

- `i/ı, ɩ̇/ɩ, ɪ̇/ɪ ` — These letters, the iota with or without the dot represent the same vowel in the TPA. While the IPA always writes them with the dot on top, in the TPA, it is not supposed to be written that way. This helps us fit diacritics on top of the 'i'. In the IPA, the small capital 'ɪ' and the 'i' are considered separate vowels, but not here. We have { ᵻ } where they have [ɪ] in the IPA.

- `ɨ, ᵼ̇/ᵼ, ᵻ̇/ᵻ` — Same scenario as above but for the unrounded near-tense front vowel.

- `a/ɑ` — Again, in the IPA, theꜱe two variations are considered separate vowels but not here. These two glyphic variations are just that, glyphic variations. They are the same vowels.

- `ᴇ/ɛ` — IPA uses the 'ɛ'. But here, we can also use the small capital 'ᴇ'. This is also good for conformity with letters like 'ᴁ , ɶ' and 'ᴀ' already there in the TPA. 'ᴇ' is the preferred letter.

- `ɡ/g` — Unicode actually has two separate gʼs. They are just glyphic variants of each other. The 'ɡ' with the open tail is called a "script g" and the other g with a closed tail is called a 'double-storey g' or 'closed loop g'. IPA favours the open tail ɡ, but here in the TPA, for our needs and purposes they represent the same sound, the voiced velar plosive. 'g' is the preferred letter.

- `ȷ/j` — These both represent the voiced palatal plosive in the TPA. The [ ȷ ] represents the voiced palatal plosive in the IPA and the [ j ] represents the voiced palatal approximant. The reason for this change is that we use the letter 'y' for the voiced palatal approximant in the TPA and the dots (the title) just don't make a difference.
  I would however highly suggest avoiding using the dotted version in the TPA, because it will confuse people who use the IPA.

- `ɟ/ɉ` — Same scenario as above but for the affricate letter.

- `ʝ` — This is the letter for the voiced alveolo-palatal affricate in the IPA. IPA uses this letter for the voiced palatal fricative while the TPA uses the letter 'ỿ'.

- `{ ꞵ } / { β }` "latin small letter beta" / (U+03B2) "greek small letter beta".

  In this scenario, the Latin letter is preferred. In fact, there are only 3 Greek letters in the TPA, and 0 Cyrillic letters out of the total 150 letters.

##### Marking affrication: { ◌̾ }

Why is there an affrication diacritic in the TPA { ◌̾ } ?

Some phones can be affricated on their own. I think that terminology is also unique to this document. This is separate from the affricate consonants. The best example for affrication is the affricated bilabial click (the kissing sound but with affrication). This is done by first making a stop with the lips, then making the lips rounded and then sucking the air in through a small opening. The result is an "affricated bilabial click", represented exactly by this letter { ʘ̊̾ } in the TPA.

This results in a high pitched voiceless sound, and affrication is the secondary articulation that is taking place here. The TPA tries to accommodate all such phonetic phenomena, this was noted and implemented. For example, { ʘ ʘ̊ ʘ̊̾ } are all valid pronunciations.

So, what I am saying is, "affrication" is a kind of a secondary articulation while "affricates" are a kind of a manner of articulation and they can both be marked without problems in the TPA.

##### Marking Co-Articulation: { ◌͜◌ }, { ◌͡◌ }, {◌͡◌͡◌}, {◌͜◌͜◌}

The co-articulation diacritic { ◌͜◌ } or { ◌͡◌ } is there to show that two or more sounds are pronounced at the same time and not separately or successively. it is also possible to mark three sounds at the same time by using this diacritic twice {◌͡◌͡◌} or {◌͜◌͜◌}. Preferably, we would have an arc that goes over the three letters here, but Unicode does not have a character for that. But, if in the future they do ever add that into Unicode, it can be used instead. This combining diacritic is called a tie bar and it can not be used under certain circumstances. For example, we can not use it on both a voiceless character and a voiced character. We can only use it with both voiceless or both voiced characters as sounds can not be voiceless and voiced a the same time.

##### Marking Palatalisation (lingual raising): { ◌̑ }, { ◌͜y }

Simply write a ' y ' next to the letter and tie it with a tie bar. Such as "build" = { b͜yuld } 
A superscript ' ʸ ' is not preferred to be used here. The IPA uses [ ◌ʲ ] instead. I decided to not use the superscript letters as that means introducing a whole subset of letters into the alphabet.

Another way of doing this using the inverted breve diacritic. { ◌̑ } such as { b̑uld }.
I picked this combining diacritic because it resembles the tongue going upwards towards the palate which is what happens here.

##### Marking Velarisation (lingual retraction): { ◌͐ }, { ◌͜ɰ }

We mark this phenomenon in the TPA, also known as the "dark L". The way the 'L's are pronounced in English for example with the ɰ letter.
For example, { l͜ɰ }. We can also use the combining diacritic { ◌͐ }, { l͐ }. For example English word "all" = {ɔl͐). I personally think the superscript form looks bad. I picked this combining diacritic because it resembles the tongue being retracted back which is what happens here.

The IPA uses [ lˠ ] instead. I object to this because this letter [ ɣ ] is being used for the voiced velar fricative.
Which is not what is taking place here. Instead, for velarisation, [ ɰ ] should always be used.

##### Marking Aspiration: { ◌ͪ }, { ◌͜h }

This is marked with the letter 'h'. For example, the Hindi word ' धर्म ' can be transcribed as { d͜haɹm } or as {dͪaɹm}.

##### Marking Whistling: { ◌̎ }

The double vertical line combining diacritic can be used to mark a whistled pronunciation. { ◌̎ }
I believe these are particularly useful for the Shona language from Mozambique, such as { s̎ } and { ş̎ }.

##### Marking Labialisation ( labial rounding ): { ◌̊ }, { ◌͜w }

The combining ring above diacritic { ◌̊ } is used to mark that the lips are made rounded during the pronunciation of the sound. I picked this diacritic because it looks like the shape of rounded lips. It should not be used with vowel letters that are already rounded such as {o̊} or {ů} as it is only superfluous there.

##### Marking Labial Compression: { ◌͜β }

This is just like the labial rounding but instead of rounding the lips, the lips are brought closer to each other instead or compressed.

##### Marking Voicelessness: { o̥ }

This diacritic is used to make an otherwise voiced letter voiceless. This can be used on letters such as the nasal letters or the vowels which do not have voiceless forms in the TPA, although technically, they can be voiceless.  
For example: {m̥, n̥, l̥, o̥, u̥, e̥)

##### Marking Vowel Reduction: { o̦ }

##### Marking Vowel Harmony: { ọ }

##### Marking Devoicing: { o͚ }

This shows that what was normally voiced in the base word has now become devoiced, that is, it is voiceless now. { d͚ }
It just uses the double ring below instead of the single ring below as is the case in making voiceless letters out of voiced ones.

##### Marking Whispering (all voiceless): {∘◌◌◌∘ }

In this scenario, you would put the voiceless marker on all the voiced letters, which will make everything voiceless. But, an easier way is to put everything between the "ring operators" {∘◌◌◌ ◌◌◌◌ ◌◌∘ }.

##### Marking Glottalisation (glottal closure): {◌̉} {◌͡ʔ} {◌͡ɂ}, marking "no audible release": {◌̚} {◌¬}

I decided to cover these two concepts together as they are relevant to each other. This secondary articulation shows that a glottal closure is taking place while or right after the phone is pronounced. It is different than the IPAʼs "unreleased" plosives and it should not be confused with it. Iʼs exact usage is a little complex. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_audible_release
`"In most dialects of English, the first stop of a cluster has no audible release, as in apt [ˈæp̚t], doctor [ˈdɒk̚tʰɚ], or logged on [ˌlɒɡ̚dˈɒn]. Although such sounds are frequently described as "unreleased", the reality is that since the two consonants overlap, the release of the former takes place during the hold of the latter, masking the former's release and making it inaudible."`

Here, we see a correct explanation for the "no audible release". I take this explanation here directly from the IPA and the diacritic as well ( ◌̚ ). The diacritic looks quite distinct and it does not look like the other diacritics of the TPA. It can be used as such. However, I am doubtful as to its use for plosives that are not in such clusters as in the example above. If we did not have such plosive clusters and if we were to have this at the end of words for example which is often discussed in Korean phonology, I believe instead we are seeing a case of glottal closure. I am able to make these articulations myself. For example. Letʼs look at the Korean word "일곱" which means the number "seven".
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%EC%9D%BC%EA%B3%B1

Here in this Wiktionary page, we can see that its pronunciation is being given with the final plosive with the inaudible release combining diacritic. However, instead, what we may be seeing here is a glottal closure accompanying the [p]. The difference between the "glottalisation" or "glottal closure" as a secondary articulation compared with the "no audible release" is that, in the "no audible release", the glottis is not closed, while here the glottis is closed briefly, then opened again.

##### Marking Rhotacisation (lingual curl): { ◌᷾ }, { ◌͡ɻ }

Same combining diacritic as the velarisation but facing left instead. This is to show the shape of the tongue curling up towards the palate { ◌᷾ }.

##### Marking Pharyngealisation (epiglottal restriction): {◌͡ʕ}

This is particularly useful in Arabic and it is marked with the character 'ʕ'.
It implies that there is epiglottal restriction accompanying the articulation.

##### Marking Ejective Pronunciations (glottalic egressives): {◌↑}, {◌͜↑}

These are marked with the upwards arrow written right of the letter. They can also be optionally tied with a tie bar. We can use the Unicode "upwards arrow". IPA writes them like this [ pʼ, tʼ, kʼ, sʼ, fʼ ]. These do not have their own specific letters and can not have them because there are too many of them, so we have to use the regular pulmonic letter + the upwards arrow and I believe it is much better than the apostrophe that the IPA is using. These markers must never be used with any voiced letter as ejectives can not be voiced. Also, they must never be used with any non-strictives such as approximants and vowels. They can however be used with the bilateral approximants and fricatives, affricates and plosives. For example, these are all invalid { w͜￪ }, { u͜￪ }, { a͜￪ }.

##### Marking Implosive Pronunciation (glotttalic ingressives): {◌↓}, {◌͜↓}

We mark Implosives with the use of the downwards arrow. This practice is taken directly from the IPA into the TPA. I also got the idea to mark ejectives using an upwards arrow from here. However, in the IPA, they had specific letters for voiceless and voiced implosives such as { ƥ, ɓ, ƭ, ɗ, ̢ƭ, ᶑ, ƙ, ɠ, ʠ, ʛ }. Those letters are intentionally not being used in the TPA for other letters just in case. I have excluded them from the keyboard because there arenʼt enough keys to accommodate them. They are the same pulmonic letters but with a rightwards hook that is attached to them on top. They are all precomposed letters except for { ̢ƭ }. These hooked letters were taken directly from the IPA and so was the downwards arrow. They are exactly the same here in the TPA. So, there are two ways to write the implosives, either as specific letters or with the plosive letter plus the downwards arrow. In the TPA, I prefer only the arrow method.

Also of note, these letters are directly based on the plosives as implosives. Any other manner such as affricates or fricatives letʼs say can not be glottalic ingressive and thus there are no letters for those. This is in contrast with the ejectives which can be fricatives for example.

##### Marking Pulmonic Ingressive Pronunciation { ◌￩ } { ◌͜￩ }

This is basically backwards speech. They are not easy to pronounce and I donʼt believe they are used in any languages, but they are included for completeness.
Sometimes people do this when they gasp.

##### Marking Nasal Ingressive Pronunciation { ◌￩̃ }, { ◌͜￩̃ }

This is typed with the ingressive marker as above + the nasalisation diacritic on top of it.
For example, a "snort" is correctly written as { ꝶ͜￩̃ }. Some fonts may display this incorrectly.

##### Marking Pulmonic Egressive Pronunciation { ◌￫ } { ◌͜￫ }

The pulmonic egressive marker is the right facing arrow ( ◌￫ ) ( ◌͜￫ ). This is possibly the most redundant and useless of the arrow markers though as all of the letters are by default pulmonic egressive anyway. So, you donʼt necessarily have to use this arrow as { s͜￫ } is the same thing as { s } anyway. This arrow can not be used with anything that is not pulmonic egressive as that just constitutes an error such as with click letters for example { ǂ￫ } because clicks are lingual and are not pulmonic. This also helps us complete our arrow set.

##### Marking Tones {ꜛ◌, ꜜ◌} {◌᷄, ◌᷆, ◌̀, ◌́, ◌̂, ◌̌ }, { ◌◌◌¹²³, ◌◌◌123 }, { ꜌ ꜊ ꜈ }, { ꜑ ꜏ ꜍ }, { ˥ ˧ ˩ }, { ꜒ ꜔ ꜖ }, { ˩˥ ˧˥ ˨˦ ˩˧ ˩˩˧ }, { ˥˩ ˥˧ ˦˨ ˧˩ ˥˥˧ }, { ◌◌◌˧˥ }

We mark a lower shift in tone with ꜜ◌ and a higher shift in tone with ꜛ◌.
ありがとう {aɾɪgaꜛᴛo} / {aɾɪgaꜜᴛo}

For contour tones (gliding tones), we can use the combining diacritics that go over the vowel letters like in Pinyin { ◌᷄, ◌᷆, ◌̀, ◌́, ◌̂, ◌̌ }.
We can use the numerical markers as superscript numerals or normal size numerals { ◌¹²³, ◌123 }.
We can also use graphical markers such as { ꜌ ꜊ ꜈ }, { ꜑ ꜏ ꜍ }, { ˥ ˧ ˩ }, { ꜒ ꜔ ꜖ }, { ˩˥ ˧˥ ˨˦ ˩˧ ˩˩˧ }, { ˥˩ ˥˧ ˦˨ ˧˩ ˥˥˧ } that go right of the words such as { ◌◌◌˧˥ }.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_letter

Although, typically a 5 level distinction is made with tones, I believe a 3 level distinction suffices. In this scenario I just use high, mid and low. I think it is simpler this way without necessarily killing precision. But, the 5 level system is not entirely incorrect either. Also, three of these fit better into the numpad as I type them using the numpad.

Marking High Tone {ꜛ◌}, {◌³}, {◌꜈}, (◌꜒)
Marking Mid Tone {◌}, {◌²}
Marking Low Tone {ꜜ◌}, { ◌̄¹ }, {◌꜌}, (◌꜖)

##### Marking Intonation: {🡕◌◌◌ ◌◌◌ ◌◌ ◌◌◌◌🡕}, {🡖◌◌◌ ◌◌◌ ◌◌ ◌◌◌◌🡖}

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intonation_(linguistics)

This is similar to tone or pitch as described in this document but it has to do with full sentences. A good example is when people as a question such as {🡕coming to the game tonight?🡕}.

##### Marking Phonetic Stress: { ◌̱ }, { ◌͟◌ }, { ◌̱̱ }

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics)

In the IPA, phonetic stress is marked differently using an external symbol. But in the TPA, we just draw a line under the letter instead. If we want to differentiate betweeen "primary stress" and "secondary stress" as the TPA does, we can just draw two lines under the letters, or type the diacritic twice in computers. That would then be the primary stress, and the secondary stress can be marked by just one line.

##### Marking Liaison: { ◌‿◌ }, { ◌⁀◌ }

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_(French)

This character looks exactly like the combining tie bar that we are familiar with. However, there is one difference. This character is not a combining character and it is an independent character that stands by itself. It is used to mark a phonological absence between two separate words. It is particularly useful in French and in Arabic where words do liaise. It is the same character and has the same use as in the IPA. However, There, only the lower tie is listed while here we can use either of which.

##### Marking Optional Pronunciation: { ◌◌(◌)◌, ◌◌(◌) }

This feature is basically where we mark a certain letter within a word within parentheses.
For example, we can write the English word "debt" as {dept} or {de(p)t}.

##### Marking Syllabification: { ◌◌ˌ◌◌◌ˈ◌◌ˌ◌◌◌ }

Same system as the IPA, but we also draw lines under stressed vowels and syllables.

##### Marking Nasalisation { ◌̃ }

These just mark that a vowel is being pronounced as a nasal vowel as opposed to an oral vowel.
It is the same diacritic as the IPA.

##### Marking Denasalisation { ◌͊ }

I picked this diacritic because it looks just like the nasalisation diacritic but with a slash through it. This indicates to us that something that was normally nasalised is now denasalised and is oralised instead. I donʼt know if it would be useful but it is here anyway, and it does not conflict with another diacritic.

##### Marking Paralinguistic Functions:

Yes, the TPA has a symbol for the swallowing function. It is a triangle { △ }.

{ ◊ } is for a hiccup.
{ ƾ } is for a cough.
{ ꝶ͜￩̃ } is a snort.

I just created these, perhaps for fun. The cough is a "glottal plosive" and the snort is a "nasal ingressive uvular trill".
That is just what they are, if analysed phonetically.

Marking a stuttered pronunciation: p\p\p
The stuttered pronunciation just shows us a repeat of the pronounced consonant.

##### Marking phone deletion: { ◌͓ }

Simply write an 'x' under the letter that is not being pronounced anymore. Such as { ◌͓ }.

##### Marking Lenition: { ◌̝ }

What this marker does is indicate that a phone is now being pronounced with less restriction in the vocal tract or that it has lenited. For example Turkish "kayık" (boat) versus "kayığ̝ın" (of the boat). The 'k' has lenited to 'ğ'. That is, it went from a plosive pronunciation to an approximant pronunciation within the same place of articulation. This can also be useful in dealing with historical linguistics as words often lenite over time as well.

##### Marking Fortition: { ◌̞ }

This is just like the lenition but the opposite phenomenon. A sound becomes more constricted or harder to pronounce instead.

##### Marking Lengthening:

What this does is, it shows that a vowel which is normally pronounced short is now being pronounced long. It is supposed to be marked with the combining rightwards arrow below or above but the fonts just can not render the character correctly.

##### Marking Shortening:

Same thing as above but instead it shows that a long vowel or a long pronunciation is now short. It is supposed to be the combining leftwards arrow above or below but again, the fonts just do not display these characters properly.

##### Marking Grammatical Gender: { ◌◌◌ᵐ }, { ◌◌◌ᶠ }, { ◌◌◌ⁿ }

masuline (abbreviation m.) { ◌◌◌ᵐ }
femionine (abbreviation f.) { ◌◌◌ᶠ }
neuter (abbreviation n.) { ◌◌◌ⁿ }

These are intended to be used with words that change for grammatical gender. It is an easy, one character way of marking grammatical gender. Some languages make a two way distinction for example, French and Spanish while others make a three way distinction including neuter such as German and Greek. Some languages do not make any gender inflections such as English and Turkish although, they do still have grammatical gender to a limited extent. All three can be represented by these symbols.

##### Marking Grammatical Number:

singular (abbreviation sg.) { ◌◌◌ˢᵍ }
plural (abbreviation pl.) { ◌◌◌ᵖˡ }
dual (abbreviation dl.) { ◌◌◌ᵈˡ }
trial (abbreviation tl.) { ◌◌◌ᵗˡ }

##### Writing the tittle: { ◌̇ }

The tittle is the name of the small dot that goes on top of letters such as the 'i' or the 'j'. In the TPA, we donʼt write the tittle. We can use the dotless forms of these letters {ı, ȷ} and that does not pose a problem. However, if we want to write the tittle, we can use the "combining dot above (U+0307)" on top of the characters.

#### CHAPTER FIVE (Ⅴ): Ordering of the sounds in the TPA:

In the Translingual Phonetic Alphabet, the first place of articulation is considered the glottis and the last place of articulation is the nasal cavity.
For example, this is the order as follows (not including all of the places of articulations):

Glottal ➜ Epiglottal ➜ Uvular ➜ Velar ➜ Palatal ➜ Alveolar ➜ Dental ➜ Interdental ➜ Labiodental ➜ Bilabial ➜ Nasal

Pay attention, speech does not at all start at the lips but it starts at the glottis. This is because the air first has to pass through the glottis before it can pass through anywhere else. Thus, this is the correct ordering. I am not the only one ordering the sounds starting from the "last" and the most restricted position. The Devanagari alphabet also does the same thing and starts ordering from the most restricted and rear sounds where often the first letter is considered ' क ' 'ka',

#### CHAPTER SIX (Ⅵ): Using the "Precise Phonetic" notation system:

The TPA offers a way to transcribe words with more accuracy then what would be typically needed. In this scenario, the person intentionally chooses not to omit anything in order to be more accurate, but it will make the transcription look more complicated.

For example, in this method, you would typically include the labial rounding diacritic for any contoid that is before a labially rounded vocoid as this is in fact what the body naturally accounts for in a phenomenon known as "phonetic assimilation".

Example: ⟨Portugal⟩ = {po̱ɻɕəgəl᷾} = {{p̱̊o̱ɻɕəgəl᷾}}

Here, we accounted for the phonological phenomenon called reducing, as the { t } became a { ɕ }. We also accounted for the whole syllable receiving stress instead of only the vocoid by placing the stress marker also below the contoid letter.

Of course, this takes away from the legibility but the option to do very accurate transcriptions are there.

#### CHAPTER SEVEN (Ⅶ): Criticism of phonetic transcriptions with the IPA:

The very first thing I want to criticise is the vowels of the IPA.

- The specific letter [ɚ] should not even be there in favour of ( əɻ ). No other vowel letter has such a specific rhotic form and this schwa letter should not either.

- I just think that letters like ' ɒ, ä, ɐ, ɑ, ʌ ' just should not be there. Only the letter 'a' and its more open version {ᴀ} is valid. This then leads to people using these letters in a rather falseful way. For example, I saw someone spell out the Greek word " καρδιά " as [ kɐrðia ]. Why, when it would actually be simpler and more factual to spell it out as { karðia }. And is the first 'a' there different than the last one? It is even more shocking to see people insist on these letters when no language clearly makes such a distinction between these "a" letters. Well, the TPA just throws out the use of all of those letters and instead just uses {a, ᴀ} for open rear vowels instead.
- The IPA is also calling 'æ' a front vowel, when it is clearly a central open vowel. Also, it is classifying 'a' incorrectly as a front vowel when it is a back vowel. I am still shocked to see how they can be so wrong when it comes to the vowels.
